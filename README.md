# Base React App

Note: This setup is for Mac, you will have to do the equivalent if you use Linux or Windows

## Overview

- Runs on Docker. More on Docker [here](./docs/DOCKER.md).
- Stack: React, GraphQL, Apollo Server, Prisma and TypeScript. More on the stack [here](./docs/STACK.md)
- Routes are managed and generated for all apps by [route-codegen](https://github.com/eddeee888/route-codegen)
- Monorepo setup with Yarn workspaces
- Has scripts to set up and run main app commands. All scripts are located [here](./bin/)

### üåü Setting up CLI (Recommended)

To start on MacOS, setting up the CLI command to make development easier. Go to the root of the project and run the init script.

For convenience, this will install packages, set up SSL and docker-machine.

```
$ ./bin/init.sh
```

More on how it works [here](./docs/INIT.md)

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Start the App!

#### Set up the Docker environment

We use Docker machine since it gives us better performance compared to Docker for Mac. We create the machine and DNS resolver using the following command:

```
$ bra vm-up
```

Then, we switch into the docker-machine environment by running:

```
$ eval $(docker-machine env bra)
```

Running `docker` commands should now work. For example:

```
$ docker ps
```

#### Turn on the containers the first time

```
$ bra build
$ bra up
```

Once they have successfully built, go to the following URL from your favourite browser:

```
https://bra.com.vm/
```

#### Generate dummy data

Here's the script to generate some dummy data to get started!

```
$ bra init-data
```

#### Start containers without building

```
$ bra start
```

#### Turn off everything

```
$ bra vm-down
```
