# The stack

This app uses GraphQL end-to-end with auto generated typings and resolvers.

Endpoint + subscription: `/graphql`

Interactive endpoint (graphiql): `/graphql/interactive`

## Frontends - React

- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for SPA
- [NextJS](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) for SEO pages

## Backend - GraphQL server with autogenerated resolvers

- [Apollo Server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server)

## Data layer - prisma

We use prisma (https://www.prisma.io/) as our graphql data layer. Prisma ecosystem helps us create strongly typed TypeScript application end-to-end. The main components of prisma:

- Prisma CLI
- Prisma Client

Prisma ecosystem consists of multiple layers, all based on graphql and strongly typed. It is designed to take queries / mutations from a client through an endpoint and resolve data with another endpoint. The following graph is the workflow at the highest level

client --> graphQL endpoint --> graphQL server with prisma client --> prisma endpoint --> database

### Prisma CLI

This is the main package which can be used to run commands to deploy, migrate database and generate all CRUD commands.

### Prisma Client

Prisma client is how the running node application can interact with the database via graphQL API
